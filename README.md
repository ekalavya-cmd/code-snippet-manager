# Code Snippet Manager

The Code Snippet Manager is a full-stack web application designed to help developers store, manage, and share code snippets efficiently. Built with AngularJS on the client side and Express.js with MongoDB on the server side, this project provides a user-friendly interface to create, edit, search, and organize code snippets by language, category, and tags. It includes features such as user authentication, snippet verification, personal collections, and admin controls.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register and log in with a unique username and @csm.com email, with admin privileges for designated users.
- **Snippet Management**: Add, edit, and delete snippets with support for multiple programming languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, Ruby, PHP, SQL).
- **Search Functionality**: Filter snippets by title, code, tags, language, and category.
- **Personal Collections**: Save snippets to a personal collection for easy access.
- **Verification System**: Admins can verify or report snippets as invalid, ensuring quality control.
- **Code Highlighting**: Syntax highlighting powered by Prism.js for better code readability.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices with a modern Bootstrap-based UI.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Built-in logging system for development and debugging purposes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm**: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB**: Install MongoDB Community Server from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or use MongoDB Atlas (cloud)
- **Serve package**: Install globally for serving the client files

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ekalavya-cmd/code-snippet-manager.git
   cd code-snippet-manager
   ```

2. **Install global dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install -g serve
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   - Navigate to the `server` directory
   - Update the `.env` file with your configuration:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/snippetDB
   ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@csm.com
   JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-here
   ```

4. **Install server dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

5. **Start MongoDB**
   - If using local MongoDB: Start the MongoDB service
   - If using MongoDB Atlas: Ensure your connection string is correct in `.env`

## Running the Application

To run the application, you need to start both the server and client in separate terminal windows:

### Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd server
node index.js
```

**Expected output:**

```
Server running on port 3000
Successfully connected to MongoDB
MongoDB connection established
```

### Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Client

```bash
cd client
serve
```

**Expected output:**

```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │                                                 │
   │   Serving!                                      │
   │                                                 │
   │   - Local:            http://localhost:3000     │
   │   - On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.x:3000  │
   │                                                 │
   │   Copied local address to clipboard!            │
   │                                                 │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Note:** If port 3000 is occupied by the server, the client will automatically use the next available port (e.g., 3001, 5000, etc.).

Open the provided URL in your web browser to access the application.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /register` - Register a new user
- `POST /login` - Login user and get JWT token

### Snippets

- `GET /snippets` - Get all snippets
- `POST /snippets` - Create a new snippet
- `PUT /snippets/:id` - Update a snippet
- `DELETE /snippets/:id` - Delete a snippet (admin only)
- `GET /snippets/search` - Search snippets with filters

### Verification (Admin only)

- `PUT /snippets/:id/verify` - Mark snippet as verified
- `PUT /snippets/:id/report-invalid` - Mark snippet as invalid

### Collections

- `POST /collection` - Add snippet to personal collection
- `GET /collection` - Get user's collection
- `DELETE /collection/:snippetId` - Remove snippet from collection

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following variables:

```env
PORT=3000                                    # Server port
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/snippetDB  # MongoDB connection string
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@csm.com                    # Admin user email
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-here       # JWT signing secret
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**

   - Server: Change `PORT` in `.env` file
   - Client: The `serve` command will automatically use the next available port

2. **MongoDB Connection Failed**

   - Ensure MongoDB is running locally
   - Check the `MONGO_URI` in your `.env` file
   - For MongoDB Atlas, verify your connection string and network access

3. **Cannot Register Admin User**

   - Verify `ADMIN_EMAIL` in `.env` matches your registration email exactly
   - Check MongoDB connection and user creation logs

4. **Syntax Highlighting Not Working**
   - Ensure internet connection for CDN resources
   - Check browser console for Prism.js loading errors

### Windows 11 Specific Notes

- Use PowerShell or Command Prompt for running commands
- MongoDB service can be started via Services or MongoDB Compass
- Ensure Node.js and npm are added to your system PATH
